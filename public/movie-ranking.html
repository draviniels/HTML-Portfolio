<h1>The Best Movies, According to Drake</h1>
 
<hr />

<h2>The top 3 movies of all time:</h2>

<h3>Akira</h3>
<p><strong>I still can't fully wrap my head around this one. With
   some of the most stunning scenes and a truly haunting 
   conclusion, this is my <em>favorite</em> anime bar none.</strong></p>

<h3>Princess Bride</h3>
<p><strong>I'm this crazy about my woman or I am single. There won't be any in-between.</strong></p></h4>

<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p><strong>Is anyone really looking for a justification for this one?</strong></p></h4>
